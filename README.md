# TransientTwinklePerceptionModel

This github page is used to paper, named 'Temporal processing underlying transient twinkle perception in luminance and chromatic stimulus.': (DOI)
Almost all scripts was written by MATLAB 2024a, except for stats by R studio. 

#
It includes 5 folders: Data, main, model comparison, statistics and others.

You can find the data from each Experiment (1  ~ 4) in a Data folder.

You can find temporal integartion models in a Main folder.

In the main folder, the main script fit the data for each model, Gaussian filter or bi-phasic filter. 

You can conduct the model comparison via Model comparison folder. 

If you want to visualize the output, you can use the plotting in each folder. Those plotting script was used for the paper. 

Also, you can refer the statistics code in a Statistics folder. Stats was written by R studio.

Others folder include the function from other custom code. Each reference is written by the each function.
